# AthleticFacilitiesBookingWebApp
Instructions on how to run the web-app:
1) We open cmd(command promt) and navigate to the path of our project. The path of our current project is: C:\web-app-dev\athletic_facilities_booking. So we write on cmd the command: cd C:\web-app-dev\athletic_facilities_booking

2) Then we run the server file we created in our project with command: node server.js and what happens is the server is running on port:3000 as we defined it and our MongoDB database is connected as well.
